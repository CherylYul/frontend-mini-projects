        I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours
        and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I
        learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was
        learning and most things about my journey with the world.

      <p className="bold">How I got started</p>
      <p>
        I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would
        take notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd
        use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short
        summaries of what I learned using my own words.
      </p>
      <p>
        That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized that posting my
        learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
