                <p>If you've got lots of money and you're a bit silly, NFTs are a great way to pay for something that doesn't have any intrinsic value or even exist. Tech fashionistas are jumping on the NFT bandwagon and spending eye-watering sums of money on crypto images. Our advice: spend the weekend <a href="#">crafting an NFT</a>, and by this time next week, you'll be a millionaire.</p>
