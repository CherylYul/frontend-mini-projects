          If you've got lots of money and you're a bit silly, NFTs are a great
          way to pay for something that doesn't have any intrinsic value or even
          exist. Tech fashionistas are jumping on the NFT bandwagon and spending
          eye-watering sums of money on crypto images. Our advice: spend the
          weekend <a href="#">crafting an NFT</a>, and by this time next week,
          you'll be a millionaire.
